## Project Overview

1. Get familiar with and use HTML to identify content for web scraping.
2. Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a scrape.

6. Use Bootstrap to customize the portfolio.

## Resources
* Data source: challenge start code, https://mars.nada.gov
* Software: BeautifulSoup4, Bootstrap, Flask, MongoDB, Numpy, Pandas, Python, Jupyter Notebook, PyMongo, Splinter


## Overview of Analysis
Robin wants to take the previously created webpage and improve upon it. She would like to include scraped images of Mars's hemispheres with titles, and store this scraped data onto Mongo. Furthermore, she would like to add the images into the web app with a new design meant to highlight these images. 

## Results 
* To get the end product Robin wants, the first step is the scrape full-resolution images of Mars's Hemispheres. 

* The Web App has been updated with the images and titles. 

* The Web App is tested for responsiveness and format updates were made to make the Web App stand out. The "Scrape New Data" button was colored to make it more enticing to press, the facts table was edited, and the font sizes were changed.
